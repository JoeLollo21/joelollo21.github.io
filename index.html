		    As the final project for my Data Visualization class, I chose to investigate the <b><a href="https://data.seattle.gov/">Seattle Open Data Portal</a></b>'s dataset of <b>Seattle Public Library checkouts</b> of the work of <b>James Baldwin</b>, connecting his quotations in the Black Lives Matter movement and public protests of the murders of Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor.<br><br>
The resulting artifact was <b><a href="https://tweetsofanativeson.com/Seattle-Public-Library-2023/">a data story</a></b> published to a WordPress site answering these questions, with interactive data visualizations created using R's <b><a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a></b> library.
